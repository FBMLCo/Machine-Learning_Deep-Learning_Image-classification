# CIFAR classification project
The objective of this project is to classify images based on the CIFAR dataset using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. This project is part of an assignement in the context of the EPFL Data Science: Applied Machine Learning program.
### The following models will be set and compared:
>* KNN
>* Decision tree and Random Forest
>* Support Vector Machine
>* Logistic Regression
>* Multilayer fully connected network
>* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
